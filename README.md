### Run

This was built using python version 3.7.5 and only uses core python modules.

To test this particular implementation, run the server and then the client.

Start server:

```bash
python server.py
```

Start client:

```bash
python client.py
```

#### Things to note

The game in it's current state allows one user to play as the dealer via the server and one user as the spotter on the client.
